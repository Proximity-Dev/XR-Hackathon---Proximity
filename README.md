# XR-Hackathon---Rigger Simulator (Proximity)
Demo project for XR Hackathon 2021

Become a skilled rigger by overcoming load lifting challenges. Use your hands and voice to issue commands to move loads to their target.

**About our Project**
**The Issue**

- Rigger training involves extremely high value assets such as bridge, tower and container cranes. The chances to have such cranes at your disposition for training and practising are virtually zero. This disconnects rigger training from reality, creating a skills gap which affects workers and companies all around.

### **About our Project**

**The Issue: Explain what motivated your project. Brief idea of what you're trying to solve or implement. (400 characters max)**

- Rigger training involves extremely high value assets such as bridge, tower and container cranes. The chances to have such cranes at your disposition for training and practising are virtually zero. This disconnects rigger training from reality, creating a skills gap which affects workers and companies all around.

**Our Magic Solution: Explain what makes your project unique. Briefly how the solution works, is it new, is it innovative, something that you came on your own. (400 characters)**

- We are harnessing the unique combined power of virtual reality, hand tracking and voice commands to provide an innovative solution that makes rigger training scenarios and machinery finally accessible. With virtual assets, training is risk free while maintaining natural hand and voice interactions as in real life operations.

**How it Works: This section will only display if the steps are completed. You can also add up to 2 extra steps.**

1. Identify load destination.
2. Use hand gestures to indicate movement direction.
3. Activate microphone and speak voice command to initiate movement.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until load arrives safely to it's destination.
