# XR-Hackathon - Rigger Simulator (Proximity)
Demo project for XR Hackathon 2021

## **About our Project**
Become a skilled rigger by overcoming load lifting challenges. Use your hands and voice to issue commands to move loads to their target.

**The Issue**
Rigger training involves extremely high value assets such as bridge, tower and container cranes. The chances to have such cranes at your disposition for training and practising are virtually zero. This disconnects rigger training from reality, creating a skills gap which affects workers and companies all around.

**Our Magic Solution**
We are harnessing the unique combined power of virtual reality, hand tracking, voice commands and the Presence Platform to provide an innovative solution that makes rigger training scenarios and machinery finally accessible. Thanks to virtual assets, training is risk free while maintaining natural hand and voice interactions as in real life jobs.

**How it Works**
1. **Identify Target:** Move the load safely from point A to point B.
2. **Start Movement:** Use your RIGHT HAND to make a sign. Use your LEFT HAND to PRESS AND HOLD the button, say GO and RELEASE.
3. **Direct Load**: Use your RIGHT HAND to make a sign to switch directions.
4. **Stop Movement**: Use your LEFT HAND to PRESS AND HOLD the button, say STOP*and RELEASE.
5. **Avoid Obstacles!** Repeat prior steps until load arrives safely to it's destination.

Our project features a combination of hand tracking and voice commands to create natural interactions for rigger training. This proof of concept has the potential to integrate additional levels, scenarios, cranes, multi hand signs and situational voice commands.
